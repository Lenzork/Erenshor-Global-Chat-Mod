# Erenshor Global Chat Mod
This mod adds a global Chat to the game in which (real) players can communicate with each other. Adding a little bit of a "Multiplayer" Experience

# Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Melonloader Version >= 0.6.4 is needed

## Usage
The usage is pretty easy and straight forward. As soon as you enter the world with your character a connection to the global chat server will be established and you are ready to chat! No need to do anything yourself.

> [!NOTE]
> **Currently your steam name will be used when using this mod**

You can type in the chat like this:
```
@This is a message
```

or look at the screenshot below
